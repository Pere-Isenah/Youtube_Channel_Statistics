### Script Explanation
The script starts with defining a **function updateChannelData**. The updateChannelData function uses several other functions to extract the data from the channel's public video data, format it, and then output it to the Google Sheet.

The **getVideosFromChannel** function gets the playlist ID for the channel and then fetches the video details of the videos in the playlist using the Youtube Data API. The getVideoDetails function takes a video ID and returns the details of the video, including title, views, likes, dislikes, etc.

The **extractChannelIdFromUrl** function extracts the channel ID from the URL provided. The **getChannelProfileAnalytic** function gets the channel's public profile data, including the subscriber count and total number of videos.

The **design** function is used to design the output sheet.

The **updateChannelData** function then populates the sheet with the required data.

Finally, the **updateChannelDat** function calls the design function to format the output.
